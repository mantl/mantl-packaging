The idea here is that we provide a utility for users/customers to upload bundles of logs for tech support.
./mantl-logs --upload --customer-id --name
interact with consul-cli


What it needs to do...
	gather log files/directories into an archive
		default paths are in a file that can be edited by user
	add a bug report, with comments from user
	send it someplace
	take config options for where to send it
	take config for user metadata
	extensions
		take config for what to bundle
		different archive formats
		post to GH/gist/etc.

TODOS:
	explore what ansible logs look like, see about including them in an upload.
	talk to mgmt about what customer support looks like
		propose that we have a support.json file that gets downloaded to their mantl install
			that file will configure how uploads occur
